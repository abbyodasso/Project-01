        <h2>Get To Know Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Abigail McKinney-Odasso and I am a recent college graduate from the University of Virginia's College at Wise. 
                I majored in Management Information Systems with a concentration in systems.
                I am currently looking for my first entry level position within the web development field.
            </p>
            <p>I am currently working as a barista at Starbucks and as a volleyball coach. I am also actively improving my coding skills through the James Madison University Web Development Bootcamp. 
               In the fall of 2020, I was a Teacher's Assistant and a student mentor for the freshman Computer Science majors. 
               During this period, I helped the students learn new ways to use their iPad, helped them navigate through their first semester of college, and advised them on what courses to take within the upcoming years. 
               Another opportunity I had, was participating in the Summer Program for Entrepreneurship and Cybersecurity Internship. 
               This was an international program that helped me learn new cybersecurity techniques and how to successfully become a leader within a business. 
               During the program, I worked with a team to create and develop a model for a systems solutions company. 
               I have worked on many projects within my time at The University of Virginia's College at Wise. If you would like to learn more about the projects, please refer to the relevant course work section.
            </p>
            <p>I am proud to be able to pursue a career in the computer science field as a women. 
                I am honored to be the only female in my graduating class who majored in management information systems. 
                I hope to be able to share my passion for computer science with other people and share my experience as a women in the field.

        <h2>Relevant Course Work</h2>
	        <p>The most recent project that I worked on while in college was my senior seminar research project. My team and I researched a definition for hate speech, annotating hate speech, and created an algorithm to detect hate speech on twitter.</p>

	        <p>In my Cybersecurity class, I learned about ethics, encryption, and decryption. The attached folder is an encryption key generator that I created, along with a sample run.</p>

            <p>In my web development class, I created a simple website for an animal shelter. In the attached link, I have the code files along with screenshots of what the website looks like. The dogs, cats, and others pages all look the same, please refer to the cats screenshot to see the animal pages model. I also created a mock database for this project.</p>

            <p>In my Human Computer Interaction course, my team and I developed a model for an app called Snow Day. This app was an alarm that automatically adjusted when the school sent out an emergency weather alert or cancellation.</p>

        <p>
            I was apart of the University of Virginia's College at Wise Women's Volleyball Program during my time at the college. 
            While I was on the team, I was a member of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee. 
            This committee gave athletes a voice when it came to new rules, fundraising, and athletics at the college. 
            After my time on the volleyball team came to an end, I played intramural and club volleyball where I received the Female MVP SLAB award. 
            I am now coaching club volleyball.

            I have a passion for photography and graphic design. Here are some of my award winning peices:
